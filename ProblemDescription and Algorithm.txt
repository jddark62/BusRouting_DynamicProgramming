Problem Description and Modelling

Consider the bus starts at a suburban bus station  →  node 0

Let the destination be the city centre → node N + 1

Let there be N locations for bus stops from the bus station and city centre 

Each location has  2 stops (i.e), 1, -1, 2, -2, . . . N, -N , where 
i, -i → same geographical location ; opposite directions

AIM - to find the minimum distance between nodes 0 and N+1 visiting all i or -i, ∀ i ∈ { 1, 2, 3, . . . N}

ALGORITHM

Procedure f(i, S)
	
	if S = ∅
		f(i,S) = di,N+1
	else if S = { k, -k }
		f(i,S) = min( di,k + dk,N+1 , di,-k + d-k,N+1 ) 
	else
		f(i, S) = min ∀ j ∈ S ( di,j + f( j , S - { j, -j} ))
